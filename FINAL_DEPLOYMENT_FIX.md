# TK999 Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The deployed version was showing raw HTML instead of the React application because:
1. The Netlify configuration was pointing to the wrong publish directory
2. The deployment scripts were not using the correct path to the built React app
3. There was no proper redirect configuration for the SPA

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- Set the correct publish directory to `tk999-deployment/tk999-netlify-deploy/`
- Added SPA redirect rules to route all requests to `index.html`
- Added security headers for better protection

### 2. Fixed Deployment Scripts
- Updated `deploy-to-netlify.sh` to use the correct deployment directory path
- Added validation to check if the deployment directory exists
- Improved error handling and user guidance

### 3. Created Git Deployment Trigger
- Added `trigger-deploy.sh` script to automatically push changes and trigger Netlify deployment
- This enables continuous deployment through Git pushes

### 4. Added Verification Tools
- Created `verify-deployment.sh` to check deployment status
- Provided clear instructions for manual verification

## How to Deploy

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Make changes to your application
2. Build the React app (files go to `tk999-deployment/tk999-netlify-deploy/`)
3. Run `./trigger-deploy.sh` to push changes and trigger deployment

### Manual Deployment
1. Run `./deploy-to-netlify.sh` to deploy using Netlify CLI

## Verification
1. Visit https://tk999-betting-app.netlify.app/
2. You should see the beautiful solid card design React application
3. All CSS styling should be properly applied

## Troubleshooting
If you still see plain HTML:
1. Check Netlify deployment logs for errors
2. Verify all files were uploaded correctly
3. Ensure `netlify.toml` is in the repository root
4. Confirm the publish directory is set correctly in Netlify settings
