# TK999 Application Deployment - Fixed

## Summary of Changes

1. We've identified that the deployed version was showing a static demo page instead of the actual React application
2. We've fixed this by extracting the correct built application from `tk999-frontend-deployment-fixed-v2.zip`
3. The tk999-netlify-deploy directory now contains the correct files:
   - A proper index.html that loads the React application
   - JavaScript assets in the assets/ directory
   - CSS stylesheets in the assets/ directory

## Deployment Instructions

Since there are permissions issues with the Netlify CLI, please use the following manual deployment process:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click on "Sites" in the top navigation
3. Click "New site from Git" or "Import an existing project"
4. Choose "Deploy manually" or drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory
5. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Verification

After deployment, your site should show:
- The TK999 login/dashboard application
- Proper React routing between pages
- All the betting features and functionality

The deployed application will be accessible at your Netlify site URL.
