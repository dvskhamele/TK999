# Update Your TK999 Deployment

## What's Been Done

1. **Fixed the App.tsx** - Now properly imports and renders the HomePage component
2. **Rebuilt the application** - Created a new build with the correct routing
3. **Prepared updated deployment files** - Created a new deployment directory with the latest build

## Updated Deployment Files

The updated files are ready in the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory, and I've also created a zip file `tk999-frontend-update.zip` containing these files.

## How to Update Your Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
1. Download the `tk999-frontend-update.zip` file
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
3. Find your site and go to the "Deploys" tab
4. Drag and drop the zip file to deploy the updated version

### Option 2: Trigger Redeploy
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Find your site and go to the "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Trigger deploy" to redeploy from the latest Git commit

### Option 3: Git Push + Auto Deploy
1. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix App.tsx to show full homepage"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Netlify should automatically deploy the updated version

## What to Expect

After updating, your site should show the complete TK999 homepage with:
- The "TK999" heading with gradient styling
- "Sports Betting Platform" subtitle
- Register and Login buttons
- Features section
- Testimonials
- Call-to-action section

The site will now have the full visual design rather than just a simple heading.
