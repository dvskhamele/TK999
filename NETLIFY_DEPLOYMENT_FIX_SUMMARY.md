# TK999 Netlify Deployment Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The deployed application was showing the "Beautiful Solid Cards" demo page instead of the actual TK999 application. This happened because:

1. An older zip file (`tk999-definitive-deployment.zip`) containing demo files was deployed to Netlify
2. This zip file contained static HTML files with demo content instead of the actual React application
3. The correct React application files were in the `tk999-netlify-deploy` directory but were not deployed

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a new deployment zip file (`tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip`) containing the correct React application files:
   - Proper `index.html` with React entry point
   - Compiled JavaScript and CSS assets in the `assets` folder
   - All necessary files for the full TK999 application

## Files in Correct Deployment
The new `tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip` contains:
- `index.html` - Main React application entry point (with `<div id="root">`)
- `vite.svg` - Application icon
- `assets/` directory with:
  - `index-DyzbMtlF.js` - Main application JavaScript
  - `vendor-CT_6HZhJ.js` - Vendor JavaScript libraries
  - `index-CN2zB-0N.css` - Compiled CSS styles

## How to Deploy the Correct Application
1. Download the new `tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip` file
2. Unzip it to verify contents
3. Deploy to Netlify using one of these methods:
   - Drag and drop the `tk999-netlify-deploy` folder to Netlify
   - Or upload the `tk999-netlify-deployment-final.zip` file directly to Netlify

## Expected Application Features
After deploying the correct files, the application will include:
- Login/Registration system
- User dashboard with analytics
- Live betting interface with real-time updates
- Match browsing and betting
- User profile management
- Admin panel (for admin users)
- All routes working correctly (/login, /dashboard, /matches, /profile, /admin)

## Test Accounts
Use these credentials to test the application:
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / admin123
- **Staff**: staff@example.com / staff123
- **Regular User**: Any email/password (creates account automatically)
