# TK999 Application Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status
The application has been successfully built and packaged for deployment. The frontend builds correctly and the backend is ready to be deployed.

## Deployment Packages
Two deployment packages have been created:
- `tk999-frontend.zip` - Contains the built frontend files
- `tk999-backend.zip` - Contains the backend API files

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Manual Deployment
1. Download the `tk999-frontend.zip` and `tk999-backend.zip` files
2. Extract the frontend files and upload them to your static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel static hosting, etc.)
3. Extract the backend files and deploy them to a Node.js hosting provider (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.)
4. Set the required environment variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET` - A secret key for JWT token generation

### Option 2: Unified Deployment
If your hosting provider supports both static files and Node.js in a single deployment:
1. Extract both zip files into a single directory
2. Configure your hosting provider to:
   - Serve the frontend from the `frontend/dist` directory
   - Run the backend as a Node.js application from the `backend` directory
3. Set up routing so that:
   - `/api/*` requests are forwarded to the backend
   - All other requests serve the frontend

## Testing the Application Locally
You can test the frontend locally by running:
```
cd frontend/dist
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

To test the backend locally:
```
cd backend
npm start
```
The backend will run on http://localhost:3000

## API Endpoints
The backend API provides the following endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (use OTP "123456")
- `GET /api/matches` - Get all matches (no authentication required)
- `GET /api/user/dashboard` - Get user dashboard (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/wallet/deposit` - Deposit funds (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` - Withdraw funds (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/bets/place` - Place a bet (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/admin/login` - Admin login (username: "admin", password: "password")
- `GET /api/admin/data` - Get admin data (requires admin authentication)
- `PUT /api/admin/matches/:id` - Update match result (requires admin authentication)

## Note on Authentication
Most API endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The application is ready for deployment. Please follow the instructions above based on your hosting provider.
