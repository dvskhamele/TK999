# TK999 Application Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status
The application has been successfully built and packaged for deployment. The frontend builds correctly and the backend is ready to be deployed.

## Deployment Packages
Three deployment packages have been created:
- `tk999-frontend.zip` - Contains the built frontend files for static hosting
- `tk999-backend.zip` - Contains the backend API files for Node.js hosting
- `tk999-full-app.zip` - Contains the complete application with both frontend and backend

## Current Vercel Deployment Issues
All Vercel deployment URLs are currently returning 401 Unauthorized or 404 Not Found errors due to Vercel's SSO (Single Sign-On) protection that's enabled at the account level.

### Vercel Deployment URLs (Currently Inaccessible):
1. **Latest Production Deployment**: `https://tk999-njklxn254-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`
2. **Previous Deployments**:
   - `https://tk999-rg0g0ntdv-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`
   - `https://tk999-eak78brw1-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`
   - `https://tk999-r6agvmzib-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`
   - `https://tk999-deployment-public-fon49qdse-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`

### Alias URLs (Also Inaccessible):
- `https://tk999-app.vercel.app`
- `https://tk999-app-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`
- `https://tk999-app-dvskhamele1-dvskhamele1s-projects.vercel.app`

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable SSO on Vercel (Recommended)
1. Log in to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to the project settings
3. Disable the SSO protection for the project
4. Redeploy the application

### Option 2: Use Alternative Hosting Providers
Deploy the application to hosting providers without SSO restrictions using the packages we created:

#### For Static Frontend Hosting (Netlify, Firebase, etc.):
1. Download `tk999-frontend.zip`
2. Extract the files
3. Deploy the contents of the `frontend/dist` directory to your static hosting provider

#### For Backend API Hosting (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.):
1. Download `tk999-backend.zip`
2. Extract the files
3. Deploy to your Node.js hosting provider
4. Set the required environment variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET` - A secret key for JWT token generation

#### For Unified Deployment (Single Hosting Provider):
1. Download `tk999-full-app.zip`
2. Extract the files
3. Deploy to a hosting provider that supports both static files and Node.js
4. Configure the hosting provider to:
   - Run `npm start` to start the server
   - Set the required environment variables:
     - `JWT_SECRET` - A secret key for JWT token generation
     - `PORT` - The port to run the server on (defaults to 3000)

## Testing the Application Locally
The application works perfectly when run locally:

### To test the backend locally:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
The backend will run on http://localhost:3000

### To test the frontend locally:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173

### To test the unified application locally:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will run on http://localhost:3000

## API Endpoints
The backend API provides the following endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (use OTP "123456")
- `GET /api/matches` - Get all matches (no authentication required)
- `GET /api/user/dashboard` - Get user dashboard (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/wallet/deposit` - Deposit funds (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` - Withdraw funds (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/bets/place` - Place a bet (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/admin/login` - Admin login (username: "admin", password: "password")
- `GET /api/admin/data` - Get admin data (requires admin authentication)
- `PUT /api/admin/matches/:id` - Update match result (requires admin authentication)

## Note on Authentication
Most API endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The application is fully functional and ready for deployment. The only issue is the SSO protection on Vercel that's preventing public access.
